	 <img src="image/sewingwork.jpg" height="300px" style="float:right;" width="400px">
	<p style="background-color:whitesmoke; text-align: center;">In June 2022, I used to work in a sewing factory at the age of 19. After graduating from Kelantan Matriculation College, my friends and I decided to look for work experience, and we went to an interview at a company called Hing Yiap Knitting SDN BHD located in Padang Tembak, Pengkalan Chepa, Kelantan. I was given a job as a factory operator, and my job was sewing shirts. This job was quite challenging for me because I had no experience in sewing at all because in high school I took the pure science stream, while in matriculation I took the accounting course. But alhamdulillah, I can sew a little bit of clothing thanks to the teachings of the sewing teacher at the factory. This work is also very challenging because I have to work from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., including a 1-hour break. It is because this is the first time I have worked. My emotions were disturbed because I was tired, but as time passed, I was able to control my emotions and feel more grateful and in awe of my parents, who worked hard to earn a living. I only worked for 4 months in this factory because I have to continue my studies at the degree level in October 2022. This was a valuable experience for me.</p>
